# About Tensorflow API (Studying Deeplearning)

I'm studying Deeplearning with AIFFEL (school for teaching AI) in Korea. Here I post what I learned about Tensorflow and I will update up-to-date.   

## Today I learned (TIL, 2020.07.13.)
I used MNIST dataset to classify images of number 0~9. I'm not used to using Tensorflow and I'm new to deep learning. So I followed the code already built in class.
In order to classify images, first imported tensorflow and keras and then used "sequential API" to build a model.
In sequential model, built layers with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense.
